Reflection Enhanced Fairly Lightweight Editor for KSP Two Objects and Rectangles

All jokes aside, a quicker, lighter weight alternative to Unity Explorer for KSP 2.

Currently in a feature limited beta. You can view and disable game objects, fire ray casts to see what gameobject backs up visual elements, and edit various simple properties of game object componenets.
To toggle the UI, press Shift + U. To fire a raycast, press Shift + R. You can also right click on a child of a game object in the left panel to disable that child game object.
