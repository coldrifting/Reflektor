Reflection Enhanced Fairly Lightweight Editor for KSP Two Objects and Rectangles

All jokes aside, a quicker, lighter weight alternative to Unity Explorer for KSP 2.

- Browse the GameObject tree and disable objects by right clicking in the browser (Shift + Alt + Q by default).
- Fire a raycast to see what gameobjects are behind objects on the screen (Shift + Alt + R by default).
  
NEW: 
- Edit Fields/Properties of objects and invoke parameterless methods in the inspector (Shift + Alt + E by default).
- The new and improved editor spports editing of strings, numbers, booleans, enums (including multi-flag support), colors, vectors, etc, 
even inside of lists and dictionaries.
